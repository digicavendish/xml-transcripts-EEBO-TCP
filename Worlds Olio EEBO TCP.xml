Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as <span class="pl-c1">&amp;lt;</span>gap<span class="pl-c1">&amp;gt;</span>s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.

True it is, our Sex make great complaints, that men from their first Creation usurped a Supremacy to themselves, although we were made equal by Nature, which Tyrannical Goverment they have kept ever since, so that we could never come to be free, but rather more and more enslaved, using us either like Children, Fools, or Subjects, that is, to flatter or threaten us, to allure or force us to obey, and will not let us divide the World equally with them, as to Govern and Command, to direct and Dispose as they do; which Slavery hath so dejected our spirits, as we are become so stupid, that Beasts are but a Degree below us, and Men use us but a Degree above Beasts; whereas in Nature we have as clear an understand&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ing as Men, if we were bredin Schools to mature our Brains, and to manure our Understandings, that we might bring forth the Fruits of Knowledge. But to speak truth, Men have great Reason not to let us in to their Governments, for there is great difference betwixt the Masculine Brain and the Feminine, the Masculine Strength and the Feminine; For could we choose out of the World two of the a&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;blest Brain and strongest Body of each Sex, there would be great difference in the Understanding and Strength; for Nature hath made Mans Body more able to endure Labour, and Mans Brain more clear to understand and contrive than Womans; and as great a difference there is between them, as there is between the longest and strongest Willow, compared to the strongest an largest Oak; though they are both Trees, yet the Willow is but a yielding Vegeta&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ble, not fit nor proper to build Houses and Ships, as the Oak, whose strength can grapple with the greatest Winds, and plough the Fur&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;rows in the Deep; it is true, the Willows may make fine Arbours and Bowers, winding and twisting its wreathy stalks about, to make a Shadow to eclips the Light; or as a light Shield to keep off the sharp Arrows of the Sun, which cannot wound deep, because they fly far before they touch the Earth; or Men and Women may be compared to the Black-Birds, where the Hen can never sing</td>

The last and worst enemy to society, is forswearing and blasphemy; for what pleasure or advantage can a man have to blaspheme, which is to curse God, who hath the power to return his cur&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ses on his head, with horrid punishments; and for swearing, though it be allowed for the confirmation of a truth, and for the keeping of a promise whereby it is made sacred and religi&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ous, yet to make it common is to make it of no effect. Besides it shows little wit and lesse memory, that they should want words to fill up their discourse with, but what oaths are fain to supply; and for lying where there is no truth, there can can be no trust; and where there is no trust, there can be no union; and where there is no union, there can be no perfect society, but may rather be called a concourse, which is to meet rather then to unite, where society is the father of peace, the bond of love, the arm of strength, the head of policie, the heart of courage, the hand of</td>

For first, she dishonours her self, insomuch as her Company is an Aspersion to all honest Women that frequent therein, which makes the Chast to shun her Society. Next, she is a dishonour to the Family from whence she sprung, and makes the World suspect the Chastity of her Mother; for there is an old saying, &lt;hi&gt;Cat will after kind:&lt;/hi&gt; thus we see that the World is apt to judge from the Original. The third dishonour is to their Children; for were they never so Beautifull, and Virtuous, yet Families of Honour refuse to match with them, unless they bring great advantage by their Wealth; and then none will receive them into their Stock, but those whom Poverty hath eaten up; for the disgrace is like the Leprosy, never to be cured; and it infects the whole Posterity, and it gives Spots to the Family it is joyned with. The fourth and last dishonour is to the Husband; for let a Husband of a dishonest Wife be never so worthy a Man, yet her Follyes shall lessen the Esteem of his Merits to the ge&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;nerality of the World; Although he have a great Valour, a flowing Generosity, a sound Judgement, a fine Wit, and an ho&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;nest Mind; well bred, Beautifull, Rich, Honourable, yet the vulgar part of the World will point at him, as a Fool, a Coward; and all they can think to be bad in a Man; nay those excellent Virtues of Nature and Education, shall be dimm&#39;d, and lose their Gloss even to the Wife, although it be unjust to mis-prize</td>

This is the reason that Gallant, Worthy, and Wise Men are dishonoured by their dishonest Wives. Besides the Dis&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;honour, the Inconveniencies are many; First, it abolisheth all lawfull and right Inheritance; for the Child that is born in Wedlock, although begot by another Man, shall inherit the Hus&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;bands Estate, although it be known to be another Mans, by our Laws. Next, for the abuses of Industry; as for the profit and pain of his Labour to go to a Stranger. Thirdly, for the weakning of Natural Affection; for a Man that mistrusts that all are not his own, makes him not love any, because he cannot guesse which are his; rather, he hates all, for fear he should love him that brings him Dishonour, and Discontent; or at least set the Parents upon the Wrack, with Fear and Grief, as afraid to mistake their own, and grieve that their own may have too little Affection from them. Thence it takes away the tenderness of Affection from the Parents, and neglects and rigour to their Children; it makes disobedience from Children to their Parents, for the disgrace and wrong they receive; so that Suspicion is become the Master of the House, and Shame the Mistris, Unthankfulness the Steward, and nothing is entertained but Discontents.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

But Men seek for that abroad, whereof they have better at home, and the un&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;satiable Desire of Mankind makes them search for what is never to be found: But where Nature gives a Satisfactory Mind, she gives a Happy Life; and what can we imagin the Joys of Heaven, but a stint to our wandring Desires; therefore those that are</td>

But, say they, it is a dissembling to make that appear otherwise than it is. &#39;Tisanswer&#39;d, No more than to keep warm in Winter; for Cold is Natural, so is the sense of it in Winter; but Clothes to keep it out are Artificial; and the true use of the Art of Paint&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ing is to keep warm a Lawfull Affection. Besides, If we must use no more than what Nature hath given us, we must go naked; and those that have a bald Head, must not wear a Peruick, or Cap to cover it; and those that are born with one Leg shorter than the other, must not wear a high Shoe to make them even, nor indeed wear any Shoes at all, especially with Heels, because they make them seem higher, but go with the Feet bare; and those that are Crooked, must wear no Bombast; and many such Ex&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;amples may be brought. But, say some, it is a Bawd to entice, in begetting evil Desires. It is answered, No more a Bawd than Nature is in making a handsome Creature; but if they must do nothing for fear of Enticing, then Mankind must neither cut their Hair, nor pare their Nails, nor shave their Beards, nor wash their selves, which would be very slovenly, for fear they should appear so handsome, as they may perswade and entice the Lookers on to evil Desires; which if so, let them be like Swine, and wallow in Mire; but it is to be feared, that the Mire will be too hard for the evil Desires; so as there may be more brought in defence of Painting, than can be said against it. Wherefore, say they, it is lawfull both in Maids and Wives; the one, to get a good Hus&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;band; the other, to keep her Husband from coveting his Neigh&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;bours Wife; for it is an Honour for Maids to get good Hus&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;bands, because it is a kind of Reproach to live unmarried, for Marriage is Honourable, and gives a Respect to Women, unless they be incloystered, which all Constitutions will not agree withall; and an honest Wifes care is to please her Husband, if she can, when she hath him; for Marriage is the end of an honest Mind to all but Widows, for they, when they marry again, do as it were Cuckold their dead Husband, and their living. Besides, if they have Children, they make a Distraction and Division in their Families, and most commonly to the ruine of the first Hus&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;bands Estate, having so great a share, and so much power, ac&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;cording to our Laws; And though they should not marther themselves, as the Custome hath been in other Countryes, but contrary rather, to preserve their Health, and to dry their Eyes after a while of those Obsequies of Tears, which are Sacrifices to the Dead, yet to live a retired Life, to shew their unalterable Affections; for though it be fit for a Widow to put off her vio&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;lent Passion of Sorrow as well as she can, yet there is no Humour becomes that Condition better than Sadness; for Sadness, which is a moderate Grief, looks full of Fortitude, and is Humble, Modest, Gracefull, and so far from dis composing any part, as it gives a setled, and majestical Face: So Painting is most dis&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;allowable in Widows, for they should take the example of &lt;hi&gt;Ju&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;dith,&lt;/hi&gt;</td>

But some will say, that their Poverty is such, as they know not how to live, and they may be presented to such a Fortune, as may make them live happy, and free from the Misery that Poverty compels them to. It is answered, that Nature is satisfied with a little, if their Ambition be not great: but if not they must make use of the old Proverb, which is, that &lt;hi&gt;Necessity hath no Law,&lt;/hi&gt; in case they present not their Necessity to be greater than it is. But to return to Beauty, it is pleasing, either Natural or Artificial, and both to be admired; for if Art be Commendable, why not in the Face, as well as in the Feet in dancing Measures, or as in the Hand upon Musick Instruments, or in the Voyce, or in the Art of Oratory, and Poetry, which will sooner increase Desires: yet this is allowed of in all places and times, not onely in Tem&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;poral Society, but in Spiritual Unions, where &lt;hi&gt;David,&lt;/hi&gt; the Be&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;loved of God, was a great Master in the Knowledge and Practice of them. And if these Arts be Commendable, and are Graces to all parts of the Body, shall it be condemned onely for Colour in the Face? And as Beauty is the Adornment of Na&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ture, so is Art the Adornment of Beauty; and this saith the De&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;fendant against the Plaintiff. But all Opinions have, or most of them, Sides, and Factions; but my Opinion is so far with the Defendant, as I believe all Adotnments of Beauty are lawfull for Women, if the Intention be good. Yet I am utterly against the Art of Painting, out of three respects; The first is Dangerous, for most Paintings are mixed with Mercury, wherein is much Quicksilver, which is of so subtil a malignant nature, as it will fall from the Head to the Lungs, and cause Consumptions, and is the Cause of swelling about the Neck and Throat. The next is, that it is so far from Adorning, as it Dis-figures: for it will rot the Teeth, dim the Eyes, and take away both the Life and Youth of a Face, which is the grea&#39;est Beauty. Thirdly and lastly, the Sluttishness of it, and especially in the Preparatives, as Masks of Sear-Clothes, which are not onely horrid to look upon, in that they seem as Dead Bodies embowelled or embalmed, but the Stink is Offensive. Then the &lt;hi&gt;Pomatum&lt;/hi&gt; and &lt;hi&gt;Pultis,&lt;/hi&gt; which are very uneasy to lye in, wet and greasy, and very unsavoury; for all the while they have it on, it presents to their Nose a Chandlers Shop, or a greasy Dripping-pan, so as all the time they fry as it were in Grease; neither will their Perfumes mend it, and their Oils: And though I cannot say they live in Purgatory, because they shun all hot places, for they cannot have the comfortable heat of the Fire, and shun the Natural heat of the Sun, as they must live alwaies, as if they were at the North Pole, for fear the Heat should melt away their Oil, and Oily Drops can be no grace to their Face, Dry Painting shrivels up the Skin so, as it im&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;prints</td>

Cloathing, and all the Varieties of Accoutrement, in that they have none of the said former Qualities, but give a gracefull advantage to the Person. Besides, Dressing is the Poetry of Women, in shewing the Fancyes, and is the cause of imploying the greater part of a Commonwealth; for in four parts, three of them are in the Arts of Adornments; for it is not onely, Tailers, Imbroyderers, Perfumers, Milleners, Feather&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;makers, Jewellers, Mercers, Silkmen, Semsters, Shoemakers, Tiremen, and many, many more, but every one of these Trades have many Trades belong to them; as for example, How many Trades belong from the Silk-worm to the Ladies Gown? and from the Golden Mine to the Lace that is laid upon it? and so in order to all other things, which is the cause of keeping a Com&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;monwealth in Union, in busying and imploying their Minds, which keeps them from Factious Thoughts, and Designs.

Thus Virtues begot their Strength, and raised their Fame: But their good Fortune brought Plenty, and Plenty Pride; the one runs into Luxury, the other into Ambition; and Ambition begot Factions so much, that in the latter daies of their Government, though it was called a Republick, yet every Man was striving to be Chief, and setting up for themselves. And, say they, why may not &lt;hi&gt;Caesar&lt;/hi&gt; think himself as fit to be Emperor as any of his Fellow&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;Citizens, seeing the Government would change? And that it was as great an Injustice, when he cannot do another good, to do himself wrong, as to do another wrong, and do himself no good, or to do himself and another wrong; for how often was it aimed at by &lt;hi&gt;Sylla Cataline,&lt;/hi&gt; and many more, though not ripe untill &lt;hi&gt;Caesar&#39;s&lt;/hi&gt; time? so that &lt;hi&gt;Caesar&lt;/hi&gt; had not onely Necessity and Oppor&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;tunity but Justice to perswade him, on his side; for any Government is better than none; for they were come al&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;most to that pass, that there was no Unity; for every Man was against one another, but onely sided when they saw a particular Rise. But the general Faction fell into two hands, the one for a Republick, the other for a Monarch, wherein the Monarchical Faction prevailed, wherein &lt;hi&gt;Caesar&lt;/hi&gt; was Chief; and it may be a question, whether the other Faction did not take the Republick onely for Name, but had a Monarchical Design? But, say they, Envy, that is the Enemy to all Good Success, would have dis&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;claimed against the other side, if they had had the same Fortune; for Envy dyes not when Action ceaseth, but lives as long as Ho&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;nourable Fame survives; and that Good Fortune made &lt;hi&gt;Caesar&lt;/hi&gt; seem Ambitious, and &lt;hi&gt;Pompey&lt;/hi&gt; more humble by his Ill; for though Good Fortune hath many Friends, and more Followers, yet it is to the present Condition.

But, they say, Men of Action have two sides, a good side, and a bad side, and some take the good side of &lt;hi&gt;Caesar,&lt;/hi&gt; and the bad of &lt;hi&gt;Pompey;&lt;/hi&gt; others, the good side of &lt;hi&gt;Pompey,&lt;/hi&gt; and the bad of &lt;hi&gt;Caesar;&lt;/hi&gt; but the bad side lyes more open and broader than the good, which makes it so often beaten upon by Envy; for Envy dis&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;covers the one; and veils the other.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

And those Creatures are to be called Monsters, that have more parts than they should have, or fewer, or when their parts do not sit in their proper place; as for example, if a Man should have two Heads, or four Legs, or more Hands, or Feet, or Fingers, or Toes, or Eyes, or Noses, or Ears, or the like; or if the Eyes should be placed in the Breast, in the Neck, or Mouth; or the Ears in the Breast, or Belly, or behind in the Head; or if the Arms should be where the Legs are, or the Legs where the Arms are set; or that an Arm or Hand, Leg or Foot, should grow out of the Head; or if a Man should be in some kind like a Beast, and many the like Examples might be given; this being against the nature of the kind, and not according to the natural shape, may be called a Monster.

But I think it is as likely that the Brains should be full of little Substances no bigger than Atomes, set on fire by Motion, and so the Fire should go out and in, according as the Motion is slackned or increased, either by outward Objects, or inward Vapours; and when things are lost in the Memory, it is when the Fire of those Atomes is gone out, and never kindled again; and that sometimes the Memory is not so quick as at other times, is, because some Vapours damp and smother the Fire, or quench it out. But Memory is the light and life of Man, and those that have the most of those kindled Fea&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;bers, or Atomes, are the greatest Wits, and the best Poets, having the clearest Sparks. Now the Substances are plain, and not figured in new born Children, nor clearly kindled, but take Fi&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;gures as they receive Objects; and when they see their Nurse, which is the first thing they take notice of, then one of those small Substances turns into the Figure of the Nurse; yet that Figure being not kindled presently, because the moysture of the Brain hinders that Motion that kindles the Fire; and the Figure doth no good, unless it be thorowly kindled; and the brighter it is, the perfecter is the Memory.

Then they say, Beasts have no Memory, or Re&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;membrance; which if they had not, how should they return to their Holes, or Nests, when they are once gone out? And there are many Creatures, if they were carried many hundred miles, let them be but loose, and at their Liberty, and they will return to their first Habitation; wherefore they are forced to muffle many Creatures, that they may not see which way they go, because they should not know how to return. Then, that they are not Sociable, nor delight in Society; but we see they will play and sport with one another; and Sheep love Company so well, that they will not thrive, nor grow, but where there are great Flocks of them together. Then, that they have not Fancy; but we see that Nightingales have great Fancy in the variety of their Tones and Notes, and their Invention in many things beyond the In&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;vention of Man. Thus there is no Virtue, nor Vice, as Men call</td>

Besides, say they, there is a Bar that hinders the Friendship of Parents and Children, which is, the Duty and Respect which ought to be in the Child towards the Parent, and a Reservedness of the Father to the Child: But to my thinking, it is a strange Reason, that Duty and Respect should hinder Friendship, as if Friendship were built upon an open Rudeness; But certainly True Love, which is that which makes Dear Friendships, takes, more pleasure to be Commanded, and to Obey those they love, than to Command, and be Obeyed. Besides, Respect hinders not the disclosing, or the receiving into the Mind, or helping with their Bodies or Estates, or parting with Life, which are the Acts of Friendship; For I take Duty and Obedience to be from the Mind, as consenting to their De&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;sires, and respect as towards the Body; by an humble presenting of it self: But a Reservedness of the Parent to the Child, is ra&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ther a proud Insulting, and Love of Authority, than out of Love or Consideration for their good, or to keep their Natural Af&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;fection; for it must be a very Ill Nature, that sweet and kind Perswasions, free and open Relations, seasonable and secret Counsellings, willing and reasonable Actions, shall not onely keep the Natural Love, as from the Child to the Parent, but tye a perfect Friendship, as from Man to Man; unless you will say, there can be no perfect Friendship, except there be an equality of their Ages, which indeed a Child and a Parent can never be even in. But Parents are so far from making of Friendship with their Children, as they know less, and are more unacquainted with them, than with Strangers, by their reserved Formalities; or else they are so rudely Familiar with their Children, as makes their Chil&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;dren rudely Familiar with them; in which kind of Natures and Humours can be no tyes of Friendship, neither with their own, nor Strangers.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

And how many Parents have run Mad for the loss of their Children, because they have lost the hopes of their Perfections, or Excellencies, which Time might have brought forth, that might have been an Honour to their Name and Posterity, which by Death were cut off? So as it is not so much for the present Comfort they lost in their Child; for few Parents make their Children their onely or chief Society; but the expectation of the Future being lost, is that they most commonly run Mad for; for there are none that wish not themselves in a good Condition; and there are very few, that not onely wish themselves in a better Condition, though they have no cause to complain, but hope to be so; and where the Hopes are cut off, and the Desires remain, they must needs grow Impatient, and Impatiency grows Extra&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;vagant, and Extravagancy is Madness. But how seldome is it heard, that Children run Mad for their Parents? the reason is, because there is little hopes from them, but of their Estates, or Titles, if they have any; for Men never consider so much what is past, as what is to come, unless it be to compare the past time with the present, that they might guess at the Future: So that there is nothing to hope from Parents, because all things are past from them; for Men joy more in looking forward through their Posterity, than in looking back upon their Ancestors; the one is a Contemplation of Life, the other but a Contemplation of Death; and though they are sometimes proud of their Forefathers wor&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;thy Actions, yet they take more delight in the hopes of their own Posterity. And when Men grow Mad for the loss of their Estates, it is not for what they have enjoyed, but for what they would, or might have enjoyed, had not Ill Fortune been, but now they cannot. And when Men fall Mad through Despair, it is because they have no hopes of Heaven: So that Hope is the Life of Mans Thoughts, and the Ground of his Actions; it makes Piety in the Church, and Industry in the Common&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;wealth; where the want of it is a Death in Life.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

Prudence or Providence, is, to observe the Effect of Things, and to compare the past with the present, as to guess, and so to provide for the Future. Fortitude is, to suffer with as little Grief as one can, and to act with as little Fear. Now Temperance is something harder, as to abate the Appetites, and moderate our Passions: for though there are but two principal ones, as Love, and Hate, yet there are abstracted from them so many, as would take up a Long Life to know them after the strict Rules of Temperance. But indeed it is as im&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;possible to be justly Temperate, as to know the first Causes of all Things; as for example, A Man loseth a Friend, and the Loser must grieve so much, as the merit of the Loss deserves, and yet no more than will stand with his Constitution, which in many is impossible: For some, their Constitution is so weak, that the least Grief destroys them; so that of Necessity he must needs be Intemperate one way, either for the not sufficient Grief for</td>

Therefore he that can keep himself from Extravagancy, is temperate enough. But there are none that are more intemperate than Philosophers; first, in their vain Imaginations of Nature; next, in the difficult and nice Rules of Morality: So that this kind of Study kils all the Industrious Inventions that are bene&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ficial and Easy for the Life of Man, and makes one sit onely to dye, and not to live. But this kind of Study is not wholly to be neglected, but used so much, as to ballance a Man, though not to fix him; for Natural Philosophy is to be used as a Delight and Recreation in Mens Studies, as Poetry is, since they are both but Fictions, and not a Labour in Mans Life. But many Men make their Study their Graves, and bury themselves before they are dead. As for Moral Philosophy, I mean onely that part that belongs to every particular Person, not the Politick, that goeth to the framing of Commonwealths, as to make one Man live by another in Peace, without which no Man can enjoy any thing, or call any thing his own, for they would run into Hostility, though Community of Men will close into a Commonwealth for the Safety of each, as Bees and other Creatures do, that understand not Moral Philosophy, nor have they Grave and Learned Heads, to frame their Commonwealths.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

But Fire being an Element not subject to change, somtimes parts the Fray, and somtimes sets them more one against another: for in the Summer the Sun being hot, raiseth the Vapour so high that it gets into the Middle Region, and being there condenses into Wind, and when it is there it seeks a Passage out, and so falleth foul upon the Clouds, beating them about untill its Fury and Strength be spent; but in the Winter the Sun-beams being weak cannot draw the Vapour so high, and so blows uppon the Earth and amongst the lower Clouds, which by crushing them together, squeeseth out Rain, or breaks them in sunder, which falls down in Showres; this makes more Rain, and frequenter Storms in Winter than in Summer; and Thunder in Summer, because it is drawn so high that it cannot easily return. Thus Wind in the Middle Region causeth Thunder, and in the Win&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ter (going no further than the lower Region) causeth Storms;</td>

For put the Case it be as they say, that it runs out at some places, as fast as it comes in at others, yet it would wash and moulder away the Earth by the perpetual con&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;course and recourse, if not the Solidst part, yet the most Porous part. Besides, if it were so, the Earth would not be so dry as in many places it is, unless they hold, that some parts of he Earth have Veins, and other parts none. But if they say, that the Earth being so much greater in quantity than the Sea, which is the Watry part of the World, it hath not alwaies a sufficient quantity to satisfie the Drought, which causes the Veins to be dry, that Reason would make me think, that there should not be a suf&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ficient Quantity of Water to keep in a Body, to make a Sea so large to run about it, especially of that depth the Sea is of, and to run through the vast Earth, besides feeding the Air with Va&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;pours. Thus if there were less Water than Earth, the Earth-Ball would be burnt up, or at least so dry, as to bear nothing; and if the Water were more than the Earth, the Earth would be drowned. Wherefore, in my opinion, the Ingredients of the World are equally mix&#39;d, and proportionably made, as Earth, Water, Air, and Fire; so the Sun proportionable to the rest of the Planets, and the Planets proportionable to the Sun: so that the whole Globe is in equal temper, and the whole Body sound; and though we, who know not the Constitution of the World, may think sometimes the Elements are distempered, which is their natural temper to be so, but not in our knowledge to know how.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

That is the reason, that the longer the Perspective is, or the Pipe, or Trunk, the clearer and per&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;fecter we see, and hear: for a Pipe, or a hollow Trunk, gathers up the several Letters, and Words, as a Perspective gathers up the several Objects. Besides, the Eye and the Ear are much of the nature of a Burning-glass, which gathers all the loose and scattered Beams of the Sun to a Point, becoming there so strong, being united, as the Reflexion strike upon all Bodies, it meets, and peirceth into whatsoever is Porous: Just so the Reflexions of what the Senses have gathered together, strike upon the Optick Nerve, and peirce into the Brain; and if the Species of Sense were so material as those Species which are drawn from grosser Bodies, the Nose would see a Sent, and the Ear see a Sound, as well as the Eyes see a grosser Object which is pre&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;sented to it: But the Matter being Thin, and Aery, the Objects cannot be so soild and substantial, as to make a Figurative Body to last so long as for our gross Senses to see.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

But the reason of raising such Imaginations in Man, is, because they find by practice, that they can extract and divide one Quality from another, though it may be in question, whether they can do it purely or no, but so as to deform that Nature hath formed: But to compass and make as Nature doth, as they imagin they can, is such a Difficulty, as I believe they have not the power to perform; for to divide, or sub&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;stract, is to undo; and Nature hath given that Faculty to Man to do some things when he will, but not in all, as, he may ruin and destroy that he cannot build, or renew; &amp;amp; though he be an Instru&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ment, as all other things are, to further Natures Works, since she is pleased to work one thing out of another, not making new Prin&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ciples for every thing, yet he cannot work as she worketh: for though he can extract, yet he cannot make; for he may extract Fire out of a thing, but he cannot make the principle Element of Fire; so of Water and Earth; no more can he make the Elizar, than he can make the Sun, Sea, or Earth; and so it seems as</td>

But if there be much Blood, and thin, then by the agitation it grows hot, or else by the many Spirits in much Blood, it begets too much Motion, Motion Heat, and Heat and Motion fires the Blood, and inflames the Spirits, which causeth Feavers of all sorts, Frenzies, and Consumptions; for there may be as well too much Motion in the Body, as too little. But when the Parts of the Body are congeal&#39;d, or tyed up with Cold, then the Blood &lt;note place=&quot;margin&quot;&gt;Apoplexies come by the stoppage of the Blood.&lt;/note&gt; cannot run, nor the Spirits work, but Motion ceaseth, and the ceasing of Natural Motion is Death.

But there must be several sorts of Physick given to several Constitutions, as Husbandmen sow several sorts of Grain; as, some Humours must be digged up with Penetra&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ting Medicines, other Humours plowed up with Fomenting Me&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;dicines; some Humours harrowed with Extenuating Medicines, others raked as with Drawing and Attractive Medicines; some must be watered with Solable and Sucking Medicines, others must be manured and nourished with fine Light-Meats, and Gelly Broths; others must be comforted with the hot Sun of Cordials. Thus if Bodies be not husbanded according to the Nature Constitution of the Soyl, they will never have a suf&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ficient Stock of Health to pay Life, their Land lord, his Rent; and Death will seize upon their Lease, as forfeited to him before the Rent-day.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

Thus the breathing Passages of the Body being stopp&#39;d, there flyes up so much grosser Vapours to the Head, as &lt;note place=&quot;margin&quot;&gt;Vapoun thick&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ens into Wa&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ter, Water in&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;to Flegm; Cold congeals it Stone, Heat confirms it like Metal.&lt;/note&gt; choaks the Brain, and smothers the Vital Spirits there; and the Body having less Vent in Winter than in Summer, grows so full of Humours, as obstructs the Nerves and Muscles, with cold, clammy, or hard baked Flegm, as they cannot stir with a sen&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;sible Motion; for in the Nerves and Muscles doth the Sense of Touching live; and where they cease from moving, those Parts are dead and numm&#39;d. Gangrenes are produc&#39;d by the benum&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ming of the Spirits, as when the Spirits are congeal&#39;d to Ice,</td>

Of this Disease many dye, that would otherwise live, if they were rightly or&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;dered in their Sickness; unless the Corruption hath taken hold on the Noble Parts, before it begins to break forth, and then there is no Cure; Otherwise I believe it is as easy a Cure, as any Disease, if Moderation be used: for those that strive hastily to throw out the Corruption by forcible Medicines, as those Me&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;dicines that are hot, do like those that take out Dirt out of a Ditch, not taking time to sling it far enough; and to disperse it several waies, throw it on a high Heap, on the Verge, or Edge of the Ditch; and being too great a Quantity to consist in one Body, or to keep one place, falls back again, carrying some part of the Bank, or Earth it lay on, along with it: So in the Diseases of the Small-Pox, striving to cast out the Corruption, it falls with greater Violence, and deadly Effects, back again. Besides, most commonly this Disease is accompanied with a Feaver, and all hot Medicines increase a Feaver, and many times it is a Feaver that kils, and not the Pox; And it is to be observed, that where one lives, that hath very Hot Medicines applyed to him, ten will dye. But in these Diseases there must be applyed gentle dilating Medicines; and those that are smoothing and healing, as Possets made with very small Alc, with Figs, Rasins, and Lickerish boyled therein: Also a little letting Blood is very good, espe&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;cially if they be Feaverish, although some account it deadly, but certainly it is a safe Remedy. As for Purging Medicines, they are very dangerous, for drawing in the Humour; but a Vomit is not amiss, for that doth rather cast forth, than draw inward; neither must they keep them too hot in their Beds, nor too cold, but of a temperate heat.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

Another Opinion why they hold them cold, is, by the often Surfets many fall into by the much eating of it; and the reason they give, is, because it is so cold it cannot digest. I answer, that Surfets are caused by the Quantity, and not so much by the Quality: for there are many that surfet of strong Wines, by over-charging their Stomacks therewith; and so in all Meats, which otherwise are good and wholsome, if not immoderately taken, but according to their di&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;gesting Stomacks: for some will surfet of that Quantity, as o&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;thers shall not with ten times more; such difference is in the Na&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;tures and Constitutions of Men. There are many things by the effect cooling, by being applyed outwardly, which applying in&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;wardly, work the contrary: for Vinegar cooleth outward In&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;slammations, but shal increase an inward one, being too tender for so sharp a Medicine; and all things that corrode, make too much Motion, and all Motion heats. All Limmons, Citrons, Oranges, Pomegranates, Barberies, Currans, and the like, are accounted very cooling, being inwardly taken, and also very wholsome, which may be very good and effectual, being applyed to such Diseases as require a sharp Medicin, thogh not cooling: But if they were cooling by their nature, as there is no great reason to believe it, having as much Spirits as other Fruits have, by reason of their fulness of Liquor, though I do not say that all sorts of Liquor are full of Spirits, but such Liquors of such Natures; yet by the effect inwardly it heats, for the very corroding Quality inflames the Blood more than the Nature can cool; for all things that are</td>

But some Cattel or Plants will not thrive upon every Soyl, though rich and good, being not proper to their Natures, or to their Breedings; so it is with Men: for Custome may make that wholsome, which otherwise would shorten Life; and that is good for one Constitution, which would be pernicious to another; so as they must match Grounds to Bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

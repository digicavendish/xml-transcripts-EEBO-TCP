Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as <span class="pl-c1">&amp;lt;</span>gap<span class="pl-c1">&amp;gt;</span>s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible.

Concerning my &lt;hi&gt;Philosophical Opinions,&lt;/hi&gt; some did say, they were too Obscure, and not Plain Enough for their Understanding; I must confess, I writ that Book at first at the same time when I wrote my Poems, but to my Reason it was as Plain as I could write it, and if some Rea&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ders could not Understand it, I am not Nature to give them VVit and Understanding; yet have I since not only Over-viewed, and Reformed that Book, but made a great Addition to it, so that I believe, I have now so clearly Declared my Sense and Meaning therein, that those which Understand it not must not only be Irra&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;tional, but Insensible Creatures. As for my Book of &lt;hi&gt;Playes,&lt;/hi&gt; some find Fault they are not made up Exactly, nor the Scenes placed Justly, as also I have not in some Playes caused all the Actors to be of an Acquaintance, but this same Fault they find, I have Express&#39;d in one of the Epistles be&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;fore that Book, which they fling back upon my Work. As for my &lt;hi&gt;Orations,&lt;/hi&gt; I have heard, that some do Censure me for speaking too Freely, and Patronizing Vice too much, but I would have them not to be too Rash in Judging, but to Consider, first, whether there be a sufficient Reason that may move them to give such a Cen&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;sure, for truly I am as much an Enemy to Vice,</td>

But the Reason why I have set them forth in the Form of Letters, and not of Playes, is, first, that I have put forth Twenty Playes already, which number I thought to be Sufficient, next, I saw that Variety of Forms did Please the Readers best, and that lastly they would be more taken with the Brevity of Letters, than the Formali&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ty of Scenes, and whole Playes, whose Parts and Plots cannot be Understood till the whole Play be Read over, whereas a Short Letter will give a Full Satisfaction of what they Read.

And if he do write his own Life, it will be as a masking Dolphin, or such like thing, where the outside is painted past-board or canvas, and the inside stuff&#39;d with shreds of paper, or dirty raggs, scrap&#39;d from dunghils: and if he set his Picture before, as a Frontispiece to his Book, it will be like an ill-favour&#39;d masking Vizzard. But if he have any Friends, surely they will perswade him to im&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ploy his time about something else; but some are so unhappy, as they have nothing to imploy Time with; they can waste Time, but not im&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ploy Time; and as they waste Time, so Time wasts them. There&#39;s a saying, That men are born to live, and live to dye; but I think some are onely born to dye, and not to live; for they make small use of life, and life makes small use of them; so that in effect they were ready for the Grave, as soon as they came forth from the Womb. Wherefore if Sir &lt;hi&gt;F. O.&lt;/hi&gt; go forward with his work, he will dig his Grave through the story of his Life, and his Soul-less Wit will be buried therein.

I was very much Troubled to hear what she said, for I thought Spinning had been Easie, as not requiring much Skill to Draw, and Twist a Thread, nay, so Easie I thought it was, as I did imagine I should have Spun so Small, and Even a Thread, as to make Pure Fine Linnen Cloth, also, that my Maids and I should make so much, as I should not have needed to Buy any, either for Houshold Linnen, or Shifts. Then I bid her leave me, to Consider of some other Work; and when I was by my self alone, I call&#39;d into my Mind several Sorts of Wrought Works, most of which, though I had Will, yet I had no Skill to Work, for which I did Inwardly Complain of my Education, that my Mother did not Force me to Learn to Work with a Needle, though she found me alwayes Unapt thereto; at last I Pitch&#39;d upon Making of Silk Flowers, for I did Remember, when I was a Girl, I saw my Sisters make Silk Flowers, and I had made some, although Ill-favour&#39;dly; wherefore I sent for the Governess of my House again, and told her, that I would have her Buy several Co&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;loured Silks, for I was Resolved to Imploy my Time in making Silk-Flowers; she told me, she would Obey my Commands, but, said she, Madam, neither You, nor any that Serves You,</td>

Then I told her I would Preserve, for it was Summer time, and the Fruit Fresh, and Ripe upon the Trees; she ask&#39;d me for whom I would Preserve, for I seldom did Eat Sweet-meats my self, nor made Banquets for Strangers, unless I meant to Feed my Houshold Servants with them; besides, said she, you may keep half a score Servants with the Mony that is laid out in Sugar and Coals, which go to the Preserving only of a Few Sweet-meats, that are good for nothing, but to Breed Obstructions, and Rot the Teeth. All which when I heard, I conceived she spoke Reason; at last I considered, that I and my Maids had better be Idle, than to Employ Time Unprofitably, and to spend Mony Idely; and after I had Mused some time, I told her, how I heard my Neighbours Condemn&#39;d me, for let&lt;g ref=&quot;char:EOLhyphen&quot;/&gt;ting my Servants be Idle without Employment, and that my Maids said it was my Fault, for they were willing to be Employed in Huswifry; she said, my Neighbours would find Fault, where no Fault was, and my Maids would Complain more if they were kept to Work, than when they had liberty to Play; besides, said she, none can want Employment, as long as there are</td>
